## Introduction

This project provides a basic structure for an image search engine web application. It features a search box, a gallery to display search results, and a "Discover More" button to load additional images.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: The structure of the web page.
- CSS: The styles for various page elements.
- JavaScript: To manage user interactions and API calls.
- [Pixels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/): Used for searching and retrieving images.

## File Structure

The project files are organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the website structure.
- `css/`: Directory containing CSS files for styling.
- `scripts/`: Directory for JavaScript files to handle functionality.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Usage

To use this template, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the website.
3. You need to replace the comments in the HTML with actual code to implement the search functionality using the Pixels API.

Feel free to modify and customize the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create your own image search engine.
